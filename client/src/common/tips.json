  "Deepfaked hair causes the most noticeable fracturing in a video!",
  "Deepfake tampered videos can be of varying different qualities.",
  "One of the best tools for spotting extremely well-done deepfakes is your own contextual reasoning and worldly awareness - if you are unsure, do a bit more research to validate its authenticity.",
  "Try slowing down a video to make looking for image fracturing easier!",
  "Really good deepfakes look almost TOO perfect… watch out for them.",
  "Deepfakes' eyes have no soul, they will often look dull or dead.",
  "Simplistic or blurred backgrounds can often be signs to be wary of a deepfake! It’s much harder to synthetically create realistic surroundings.",
  "In deepfakes, the actors will try to keep things from passing in front of their face too quickly as this causes fracturing - be suspicious of well-fastened hair or slow movements/gesturing.",
